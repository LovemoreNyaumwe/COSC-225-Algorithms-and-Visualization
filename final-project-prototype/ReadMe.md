# A Star Algorithm

## Background

The [A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source to a destination.

## Instructions

Create nodes by clicking the interactive box. Create edges between the vertices by clicking one vertice then clicking another. In order to start the algorithm, click the starting vertex then click start A Star and then click the destination vertice then click end star. Click Step A Star in order to step through the vertices that lead to the  goal vertex(path to destination). To animate the algorithm click animate A Star.
